A list of 5 topics that you find interesting in relation to computers:
	1. Low Level Assembly Language. (Seriously, I love messing around with 6502, and I plan on learning 68K)
	2. The History of Computers. (I love messing around in these emulator sites like this)
	https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/sys/windows/1.01/cga/
	3. Interactive programs. (Games and Simulations)
	4. Complier Theory
	5. Artificial intelligence

A list of 5 topics that you find or think will be challenging in relation to computers:
	1. Hardware, I've also been more of a software guy, but I know learning Hardware will be important in the future.
	2. Operating systems other than Windows. (I'm going to try and properly learn Linux, I made a huge mistake before.)
	3. Web Design, I would much rather work on software applications, HTML and CSS don't have the same fun factor.
	4. Networking, a very important part of computers nowdays that also happens to be one of the most frustrating.
	5. Debugging (This should be on everyone's list)

1. How hard or easy was this assignment? (Assignment 0)
	It was pretty easy uploading code to github, since I did that a lot in CS161. Navigating Google Drive was a bit
tough though, because I haven't used it since high school.

2. Where did you find the info to try to solve the problem?
	I looked through moodle to find the link for access into this google drive folder. As for the five topics related
to computers, I had to look up a couple online to refresh my memory on all the different topics available.

3. Could we have made something easier or expanded on it in some way to make it more meaningful?
	For a introductory assignment, I think this was just right. Plus, you gave us plenty of time to figure this out
ourselves, or ask for help.

(For future assignments, I promise to go more in detail. At least a paragraph.)
